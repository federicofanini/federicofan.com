### Why Build in Public?

Most entrepreneurs keep their ideas secret. They worry about copycats, criticism, or looking foolish if they fail.

I decided to do the opposite.

---

### The Decision

Building in public means sharing your progress, your wins, and yes, your failures too.

It's uncomfortable at first. But here's what happened when I started:

**Week 1:** Posted my first update. Got 3 likes.  
**Week 2:** Shared a small win. Someone reached out to collaborate.  
**Week 3:** Posted about a problem I was facing. Got 10+ helpful replies.

> Transparency builds trust faster than anything else.

### The Benefits

1. **Accountability** - When people are watching, you show up
2. **Feedback** - Real-time insights from your audience
3. **Community** - You attract like-minded people
4. **Distribution** - Your audience grows with your product

### How to Start

You don't need a massive following. Start small:

- Share what you're working on
- Post your progress (even small wins)
- Ask questions when you're stuck
- Celebrate milestones

### The Surprising Part

The best part? **People want to help.**

When you're open about your journey, others root for you. They share your work, give feedback, and become your first customers.
