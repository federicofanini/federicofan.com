### Welcome to the MDX Demo

This article demonstrates **all available MDX features** you can use in your journey articles. From basic markdown to custom components, this is your complete reference.

---

## Text Formatting

You can use _italic text_, **bold text**, **_bold italic_**, and even ~~strikethrough~~.

### Lists

**Unordered lists:**

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item

**Ordered lists:**

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
   1. Sub-step one
   2. Sub-step two

**Task lists:**

- [x] Completed task
- [x] Another completed task
- [ ] Pending task
- [ ] Future task

---

## Blockquotes

> "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."

> **Pro tip:** You can nest blockquotes and use formatting inside them.
>
> This is a multi-line blockquote that demonstrates how you can structure longer quoted content.

---

## Code Blocks

Inline code looks like this: `const greeting = "Hello, World!";`

**JavaScript example:**

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

console.log(fibonacci(10)); // Output: 55
```

**TypeScript example:**

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const createUser = (data: User): User => {
  return {
    ...data,
    id: generateId(),
  };
};
```

**Python example:**

```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)
```

## YouTube Embed

Here's how you embed a YouTube video using the custom component:

<YouTube id="XifgHi9R5Rc" title="Demo Video" />

You can use either the video ID or the full URL - both work perfectly!

---

## Links

**Internal link:** Check out my [notes](/notes) for quick thoughts.

**External link:** Follow me on [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/fedef_an) for daily updates.

**Link with title:** Visit [my GitHub](https://github.com) for open source projects.

## Images

Images are automatically optimized with Next.js:

You can also reference images from the public folder.

## Tables

Here's a comparison table:

| Feature | Free Plan | Pro Plan | Enterprise |
| ------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Users   | 1         | 10       | Unlimited  |
| Storage | 1GB       | 100GB    | Custom     |
| Support | Email     | Priority | Dedicated  |
| Price   | $0/mo     | $29/mo   | Custom     |

---

## Horizontal Rules

Use three dashes for a horizontal rule (as seen throughout this article):

That was a horizontal rule!

---

## Headings

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

---

## Nested Content

You can combine multiple elements:

> **Quote with a list:**
>
> 1. First important point
> 2. Second important point
> 3. Third important point

**List with code:**

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run development server: `npm run dev`
- Build for production: `npm run build`

---

## Special Characters & Emojis

MDX supports emojis and special characters:

🚀 Rocket • ✅ Check mark • 💡 Light bulb • 🔥 Fire • ⚡ Lightning

## Complex Example

Let's combine multiple features:

### Building a Startup in 2025

**The three pillars:**

1. **Product** 🏗️

   - Focus on solving real problems
   - Ship fast, iterate faster
   - Listen to user feedback

2. **Distribution** 📢

   - Build in public
   - Content is king
   - Community over audience

3. **Monetization** 💰
   - Start charging early
   - Value-based pricing
   - Multiple revenue streams

> "Don't worry about competition. Worry about creating value."

Here's a simple validation framework:

```typescript
const validateIdea = {
  problem: "Is it a real pain point?",
  solution: "Does your product solve it?",
  market: "Are people willing to pay?",
  timing: "Is now the right time?",
};
```

**Results matrix:**

| Stage    | Action              | Metric        | Goal     |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Week 1-2 | Customer interviews | Conversations | 20+      |
| Week 3-4 | Build MVP           | Features      | 3-5 core |
| Week 5-6 | Launch              | Users         | 100+     |
| Week 7-8 | Iterate             | Retention     | 40%+     |
