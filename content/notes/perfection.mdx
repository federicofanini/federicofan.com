### Perfection will kill you.

It drains the fun, slows the work, and turns every idea into a burden.

Chasing "perfect" is the fastest route to burnout.

---

### Do it messy. Do it small. Do it now.

Perfection looks noble on the outside but feels like hell on the inside.

It's the quickest way to burn out and hate your own ideas.

> Momentum > perfection. Always.

### The Trap

The moment you aim for perfection, you stop building.

You start overthinking, delaying, rewriting.

Perfection burns you out long before the work begins.

### The Truth

**Done beats perfect.**

Perfection is heavy.

It makes you anxious, slow, tired.

If you keep chasing it, it'll burn you out for good.

---

Choose consistency over perfection. It's lighter.
